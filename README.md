Hello VagueMc community members!
We have a very important annoucement, we have decided to make behind the sceans of VagueMc PUBLIC! But not only have we done this we have also added an Wiki for those who would like to know more about our server. We have decided to do this to show complete transparency to our community members, after all we are here to serve you! If you are interested in seeing out To-Do-List(TDL) please check out the "Projects" tab located towards the top of this page. This will show you exactly what suggestions we are considering, what we have planned to work on, what is currently being worked on, and what we have finished! Each update will have its only "Developer Log/TDL." We have also implemented away to report bugs or issues, this can be done by using the "Issues" tab located towards the top of this page. 
Thank-you so much for being such an amazing community!
